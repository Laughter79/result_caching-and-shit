I will do everything in my power to not let happen to you what happened to my privacy and personal info. I came on Github about 5 years ago and personal data was mixed in with the code. The tinkering and clicking whatever looked cool was partly for attention. My family thought I was paranoid. No support. So I hung out here quite a bit making sure my data wasn't being published. I did it all by myself with the help of a few people that believed me. We will protect your privacy. I must say though that having your dirty laundry hung out was humbling and empowering. I have NOTHING to hide. That's freedom.
